NuGet Package Usage Instructions
=======================================================

The recommended mode to use HiQPdf library in your .NET Core Applications is to reference the NuGet package HiQPdf_NetCore.11.0.0.nupkg
in your Visual Studio projects. The NuGet package is accessible at:



When you reference the NuGet package in your project all the the dependant packages are automatically added to your project. The ASP.NET and 
Console demo applications from Samples folder are using the HiQPdf for .NET Core NuGet package.

Assembly Usage Instructions
==================================================

If you manually reference the HiQPdf Assembly for .NET Core from Assemblies folder in your applications instead of using the NuGet package 
which is the recommended usage mode, then you also have to reference the following NuGet dependant packages in your .NET Core application:

System.Drawing.Common
System.Security.Principal.Windows
System.Text.Encoding.CodePages

Finally, after your .NET Core project was built, you have to manually copy the hiqpdf.dep and HiQPdf.rda in the Bin folder
of your application near the HiQPdf.NetCore.dll assembly because these files are required at runtime.


Check Extracted Files
=====================

If you encounter difficulties in viewing the documentation or in using the software, 
please first check that the following files were not blocked by Windows when the ZIP 
archive was extracted using the Windows Explorer built-in ZIP extractor. Windows Vista and later
might block the files extracted from archives downloaded from Internet. If you extracted the files
with other programs than Windows Explorer built-in ZIP extractor, then this issue will not occur. 

HiQPdf.NetCore.dll
HiQPdf.NetCore.xml
HiQPdf.dep
HiQPdf.rda
Documentation.chm

To check whether a file has been blocked, right click on the file in Windows Explorer 
and select Properties. If there is an Unblock button in file properties then press that 
button to unblock the file.

Software Uninstallation
=======================

Because all the files installed on your computer are those that you extracted from the Zip archive, 
the uninstallation process is very simple and consists in deleting the folder where you extracted 
the files. After doing this the uninstallation is complete and no files or configuration changes 
related to HiQPdf software will remain on your computer.
